# My-Rights
My-Rights aims to help people located within the Council of Europe's jurisdiction understand what rights of the European Convention of Human Rights are relevant to them.

My-Rights provides the following three pathways to assist people to understand their rights:

For people who do not know what their rights are, they can answer the questionnaire based on their personal circumstance and will be shown which rights are relevant to them;
For researchers, lawyers or social workers, who know what rights are relevant and want to conduct macro or micro analysis on judgments; and
For anyone trying to find relevant judgments quickly can do so through the use of a sophisticated text search function
Currently, the only cases in the My-Rights database are all English judgments that are accessible in HTML format from the HUDOC database.
