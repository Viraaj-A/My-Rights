      <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>My-Rights aims to help people located within the Council of Europe's jurisdiction understand what rights of the
              European Convention of Human Rights are relevant to them.</p>
        <p>My-Rights provides the following three pathways to assist people to understand their rights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>For people who do not know what their rights are</b>, they can answer the questionnaire based on their personal
              circumstance and will be shown which rights are relevant to them;</li>
              <li><b>For researchers, lawyers or social workers</b>, who know what rights are relevant and want to conduct macro or micro analysis
                on judgments; and</li>
              <li><b>For anyone</b> trying to find relevant judgments quickly can do so through the use of a sophisticated text search function</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        <p>Currently, the only cases in the My-Rights database are all <b>English judgments that are accessible in HTML format</b>
          from the <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng" target="_blank">HUDOC database.</a></p>

      <div class="collapsible-content">
        <li>The Questionnaire works by linking multiple human rights articles to various factual situations.
        </br>By answering yes or no to specific factual questions, it becomes possible to identify which rights may or may not
        be relevant to you.</li>
        <li>It is important to note, that <b>not all of the articles within the European Convention on Human Rights</b>
        are relevant to a person. These articles are therefore not shown. For example, there are many articles that deal with the
        functioning of the European Court of Human Rights such as the multiple articles relating to 'Signature and ratification' of the convention.

        <p>The following information is reproduced exactly from the
          <a href="https://echr.coe.int/pages/home.aspx?p=home" target="_blank">European Court of Human Rights'</a> website:
        <ul>
          <li>
            "<b>The European Court of Human Rights</b> is an
              international court set up in 1959. It rules on individual
              or State applications alleging violations of the civil and
              political rights set out in the European Convention on
              Human Rights.<br>
              Since 1998 it has sat as a full-time court and individuals
              can apply to it directly.<br>
              The Court examined hundreds of thousands applications
              since it was set up. Its judgments are binding on the
              countries concerned and have led governments to
              alter their legislation and administrative practice in a
              wide range of areas. The Court’s case-law makes the
              Convention a modern and powerful living instrument
              for meeting new challenges and consolidating the rule
              of law and democracy in Europe.<br>
              The Court is based in Strasbourg, in the Human Rights
              Building designed by the British architect Lord Richard
              Rogers in 1995 – a building whose image is known
              worldwide. From here, the Court monitors respect for
              the human rights of 700 million Europeans in the 46
              Council of Europe member States that have ratified
              the Convention."<br>
          </li>
          <li>
              "<b>The European Convention on Human Rights</b> is an international treaty under which the member States of
              the Council of Europe promise to secure fundamental civil and political rights, not only to their own citizens but also to
              everyone within their jurisdiction. The Convention, which was signed on 4 November 1950 in Rome, entered into force in 1953."

          <li>The classification of <b>case importance</b>:
            <span style="display: block; text-indent:20px; margin-top:20px;">"Cases are divided into four categories, the highest level of importance being "Key Cases", followed by
            levels 1,2 and 3. The classification by levels 1,2, and 3 remains provisional until the Bureau has decided
            whether a case should appear in the Court's official (Key Cases) selection. The list of key cases selected
            by the Bureau is published on the Court's website under "Case-Law". For example, a case that was tentatively
            classified as Level 1 but ultimately selected will change to category Key cases."</span>

          <li style="margin-top:20px">The difference between the <b>Sections</b> of the European Court of Human Rights:
              <span style="display: block; text-indent:20px; margin-top:20px;">"A Section is an administrative entity and a
                Chamber is a judicial formation of the Court
                within a given Section.
                The Court has five Sections in which
                Chambers are formed. Each Section has a
                President, a Vice-President and a number of
                other judges."</span>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-top:20px">The difference between the <b>Courts and the Chamber</b>:
              <span style="display: block; text-indent:20px; margin-top:20px;">"A Chamber is composed of the President of
              the Section to which the case was assigned,
              the “national judge” (the judge elected
              in respect of the State against which the
              application was lodged) and five other
              judges designated by the Section President
              in rotation.
              The Grand Chamber is made up of the
              Court’s President and Vice-Presidents, the
              Section Presidents and the national judge,
              together with other judges selected by
              drawing of lots. When it hears a case on
              referral, it does not include any judges who
              previously sat in the Chamber which first
              examined the case."</span>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-top:20px">The difference between a <b>Decision and a Judgment</b>:
              <span style="display: block; text-indent:20px; margin-top:20px;">"A decision is usually given by a single judge,
              a Committee or a Chamber of the Court.
              It concerns only admissibility and not the
              merits of the case. Normally, a Chamber
              examines the admissibility and merits of
              an application at the same time; it will then
              deliver a judgment."</span>
